# 📜 Voynich Project

**Research and decoding of the Voynich Manuscript using Codex-aligned ontology and recursive analysis protocols.**  
This project applies modern pattern-recognition methodologies, symbolic logic mapping, and ontology-based structuring to the enduring mystery of the Voynich Manuscript.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Voynich Project** is an open-source initiative to explore, decode, and document the Voynich Manuscript through:
- **Codex-aligned ontology** — mapping entities, relationships, and symbols into a structured semantic layer.
- **Recursive analysis protocols** — iterative passes over the text, illustrations, and patterns to refine hypotheses.
- **Interdisciplinary synthesis** — blending linguistics, cryptography, symbolic systems, and AI-driven analysis.

While the manuscript has resisted traditional translation efforts for over a century, this project treats it not as a puzzle to be "solved" in one step, but as a signal to be **decoded progressively through structured recursion**.
