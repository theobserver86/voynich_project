# Voynich Decoding Project (Codex-Aligned)

**Purpose**  
This project applies Codex protocols to the systematic decoding of the Voynich manuscript — treating it as a possible independent Codex-like artifact.  
Our approach preserves reproducibility, signal integrity, and open validation.

**Core Principles**
- Work only from **authoritative sources** (Beinecke scans, EVA ZL transcription).
- Segment and analyze **by dialect** (Currier A/B) and **by section** (botanical, astro, pharma, balneo, recipes).
- Use **statistical baselines** before attempting interpretation.
- Log all hypotheses in a falsifiable, reproducible format.
- Align observations with Codex ontology (signal origin, recursion, morphology, cipher, translation).

**Phases**
1. **Data Ingest** – Acquire high-resolution scans and authoritative transcription data.
2. **Segmentation** – Tag by Currier dialect and manuscript section.
3. **Baseline Analysis** – Compute Zipf curves, entropy, mutual information, type-token ratios.
4. **Morphological Modeling** – Identify subword structures, positional effects.
5. **Cipher Diagnostics** – Test verbose/homophonic/null hypotheses.
6. **Cross-Modal Analysis** – Align labels with illustrations; cluster semantic candidates.
7. **Dialect Drift** – Quantify divergence between Currier A and B.
8. **Hypothesis Ledger** – Maintain reproducible record of all decoding attempts.
